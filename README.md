BigIntegerExtender
==================
BigIntegerExtender extends System.Numerics.BigInteger to support serialization and the calculation of square roots.
It contains:
* **BigIntegerSerializable**: with this you can serialize System.Numerics.BigInteger objects.
* **BigIntegerExtender**: it has an extension method that add the function Sqrt to System.Numerics.BigInteger objects.

To understand how it works and how to use it, see the Examples (work in progress).
